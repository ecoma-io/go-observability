  # Scrape App directly (Pull model if we configured that way)
  # But our library creates a server at METRICS_PORT.
  # Since app runs on host, and Prometheus in Docker,
  # Prometheus needs to reach 'host.docker.internal' (Mac/Windows) or Host IP (Linux).
  # For E2E simplicity, we verify Metrics arrived at Otel-Collector's Prom Exporter
  # OR we can scrape the app directly if we use host networking or correct IP.
  # Let's try to scrape the Otel Collector's exporter which bridges the gap.
